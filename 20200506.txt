4 Working With Lists

Looping through an Entire List

For - the same action with every item in a list
ex)
magicians = [‘alice’, ‘david’, ‘carolina’]
for magician in magicians:
	print(magician)

	A Closer Look at Looping


	Doing More Work Within a for loop

for magician in magicians:
	print(f”{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!”)


	Doing Something after a for loop 
magicians = [‘alice’, ‘david’, ‘carolina’]
for magician in magicians:
	print(f”{magicians.title()}, that was a great trick!”)
	print(f”I can’t wait to see your next trick, [magician.title()}.\n”)
print(“Thank you, everyone. That was a great magic show!”)

	Avoiding Indentation Errors

Forgetting to Indent
Forgetting to Indent Additional Lines
magicians = [‘alice’, ‘david’, ‘carolina’]
for magician in magicians:
	print(f”{magicians.title()}, that was a great trick!”)
print(f”I can’t wait to see your next trick, {magician.title()}.\n”)

Carolina, that was a great trick!
I can’t wait to see your next trick, Carolina.

Only Carolina gets the last print because it was the last value associated with magician

Indenting Unnecessarily
	print(message)

Indenting Unnecessarily After the Loop
magicians = [‘alice’, ‘david’, ‘carolina’]
for magician in magicians:
	print(f”{magician.title()}, that was a great trick!”)
	print(f”I can’t wait to see your next trick, [magician.title()}. \n”)

	print(“Everyone, that was great magic show!”)

Forgetting the Colon

	Making Numerical Lists

Using the range() function
 for value in range(1, 5):
	print(value)
1
2
3
4
if one argument start from 0
range(6) : 0~5

Using range() to make a list of numbers
numbers = list(range(1, 6))
print(numbers)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

even_numbers = list(range(2, 11, 2))
print(even_numbers)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

squares = []
for value in range(1, 11):
	square = value ** 2
	squares.append(square)

print(squares)
