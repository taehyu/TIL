5 If Statements

1.0 A Simple Example
cars = [‘audi’, ‘bmw’, ‘subaru’, ‘toyota’]

for car in cars:
	if car == ‘bmw’:
		print(car.upper())
	else:
		print(car.title())

2.0 Conditional Tests
conditional test : values True and False to decide whether the code in an if statement should be executed.

2.1 Checking for Equality 
= : sets the value
==: double equal sign : checks whether the value is “” / returns true if the values on the left and right side of the operator match 

2.2 Ignoring Case When Checking for Equality
two values with different capitalization are not considered equal

2.3 Checking for Inequality
requested_topping = 'mushrooms'
if requested_topping != 'anchovies':
  print("Hold the anchovies!")
2.4 Numerical Comparisons

3.0 Checking Multiple Conditions

3.1 Using and to Check Multiple Conditions
age_0 = 22
age_1 = 18
age_0 >= 21 and age_1 >= 21
(age_0 >= 21) and (age_1 >= 21)

3.2 Using or to Check Multiple Conditions

age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21
(age_0 >= 21 or age_1 >= 21)

3.3 Checking Whether a value is in a List
in : whether a particular value is already in a List
toppings = ['mushrooms', 'onions', 'pineapple']
'mushrooms' in toppings


3.4 Checking Whether a Value Is Not in a List
banned_users = ['andrew', 'carolina', 'david']
user = 'marie'

if user not in banned_users:
	print(f"{user.title()}, you can post a response if you wish.")

3.5 Boolean Expressions
game = True
can = False

4.0 If Statements
4.1 Simple if Statements
if conditional_test:
	do something
age = 19
if age>= 18:
	print("You are not old enough")
	print("Have you voted")

4.2 if-else Statements
age = 17
if age >= 18:
	print("you are not old")
else:
	print("Sorry")

4.3 The if-elif-else Chain

age = 12

if age < 4:
	price = 0
elif age < 18:
	price = 25
else:
	price = 40

print(f"Your admission cost is ${price}.")

4.4 Using Multiple elif Blocks
age = 12

if age < 4:
	price = 0
elif age < 18:
	price = 25
elif age < 65:
	price = 40
else:
	price = 20

print(f"Your admission cost in ${price}.")

4.5 Omitting the else Block
does not require an else block at the end
else block is a catchall statement, can be dangerous

4.6 Testing Multiple Conditions

toppings = ['mushrooms', 'extra cheese']

if 'mushrooms' in toppings:
	print("Adding mushrooms.")
elif 'pepperoni' in toppings:
	print("Adding pepperoni.")

print("\nFinished making your pizza!")

only want only one block of code to run : an if-elif-else
more than one block of code needs to run : use a series of independent if statements

5.0 Using if Statements with Lists
5.1 Checking for Special Items
toppings = ['mushrooms', 'green peppers', 'extra cheese']

for topping in toppings:
	print(f"Adding {topping}.")

print("\nFinished making your pizza!")

=========================================================
for toppinng in toppings:
	if topping == 'green peppers':
		print("Sorry, we are out of green peppers right now.")
	else:
		print(f"Adding {topping}.")
print("\nFinished making your pizza!")



5.2 Checking that a List is not Empty






5.3 Using Multiple Lists
